Java Calculator

This project is a simple calculator built in Java. It uses Swing for the user interface and handles basic arithmetic operations as well as parentheses grouping.

Features

Basic operations: The calculator can perform basic mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
Power operation: Users can use the caret button ("^") to raise a number to the power of another number.
Parentheses support: The calculator supports operations within parentheses, performing calculations with correct order of precedence.
Negative number support: Users can use the hyphen button ("-") to input negative numbers.
Clear and full clear options: The calculator provides two clear options: "C" for clearing the entire input, and "CE" for erasing the last entry.
Usage

To use the calculator, follow these steps:

Clone the repository.
Compile the Evaluator.java and EvaluatorUI.java files using the Java compiler (javac) through the terminal.
Run the application with the EvaluatorUI.java file using the Java Virtual Machine (java) through the terminal.
Use the calculator GUI to perform calculations. Input numbers and operations by clicking on the corresponding buttons on the interface.
If you wish to remove the compiled .class files for adding updates, use the "remove" command (rm) in the terminal, followed by "*.class".
